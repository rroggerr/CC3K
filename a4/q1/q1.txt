a) the first one loops the 2d array by row-column and the second one loops through by column-row

b) arrays   : 0.160s 
   arrays2  : 0.770s

c) when itâ€™s looped through in the order of column-row, more of the stuff is stored onto memory that has a lower hierarchy and a lower access speed, therefore it increases the runtime.
